# icsToMilk
This is a project created to help integrate Moodle with Remember the Milk.
It's a bit roundabout at the moment. There's a lot to do.

To use:
Access Moodle. Calendar should be at the top. For GTCC students, it's at http://online.gtcc.edu/calendar/view.php

Scroll to the bottom and choose Export Calendar. "This Month" is probably your best option. Click Export to get an icalexport.ics file.

Open Remember the Milk. Click the gear in the very top right. Choose Account Settings and find Email Import in there.

Now open icsToMilk, click the massive button, and find your icalexport.ics file. It should populate the text box with a list of tasks in the format of CLASS: Task by Date. Highlight it all and use ctrl+c on it.

Email what is currently in your clipboard to the account listed in Email Import on your Remember the Milk account. It should automatically fill out the list of what you need to do!

I do not suggest using a GTCC account because it will append the FERPA statement to the end of your task list!
